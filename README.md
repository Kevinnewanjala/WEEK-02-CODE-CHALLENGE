# Array Generator

## Description
This is a program that runs a function that accepts a string input and swaps the case of each character then gives an ouput of the resultant string. 

For instance, if a user inputs 'KEviN wAnjALa' the code runs and gives 'keVIn WaNJalA' as output.

# Array Generator

## Description

This Javascript function accepts two numbers as input the generates an array between them.

For example, if the two numbers are 4 and 9, the program runs then gives [4,5,6,7,8,9] as  oouput. 

Similarly, if a user inputs -3 and 9 as the two numbers, the program gives [-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9] as output.

# Prime Number Identifier

## Description

This program takes an array of numbers as input, then returns a new array containing only the prime numbers from the original array, in the order in which they appear in the original array.

For instance, if a user inputs [2,5,3,6,7,4,2,3,1], the program returns [2,5,3,7,2,3] as the new array.
